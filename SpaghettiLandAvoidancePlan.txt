Keyboard/Mouse Input (Event Handlers -> Data Structure)
  ↳ Adding bindings -> Bind an event to a function call... (callback)
    ↳ e.i if event is "w" move player forward.
    ↳ Underlying Map data structure, maps the binding to callbacks
      ↳ We must have a way to do a lookup, make sure we retrive the right
        callback?

Representation of the "World" (Game world)
  ↳ We will have a way to save and load games
  ↳ Get to and from disk? (333 esque)
  ↳ 2D Table that represents each tile/block in world
  ↳ Can't have infinitely accurate placement, Water tiles, land tiles etc...
  ↳ 351 Style a blocking?
    ↳ Could be easier to do a 2d array...? (but what's the fun in that??)

Player Built Structures on TOP of world
↳ Mines, buildings and plants...? (etc)
↳ Placeable items
  ↳ How would this affect the tile?
↳ Structures == Structs (instead of ints)

Main Menu
↳ UI Framework! (Ugh...keep simple)

Game State
↳ Struct w pointer to each states, event handlers and world (Player built stuff)
↳ Main menu and Player world.
